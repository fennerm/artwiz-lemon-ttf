# A Vectorized Version of [artwiz lemon](https://github.com/phallus/fonts)

This makes the font scalable and usable even on high definition displays.

See `potrace` for the autotrace script which was used to build the font.

## Installation

Place `lemon.ttf` in a directory in your fonts path (e.g ~/.fonts).

**Note that the font is named 'lemon', in contrast to 'artwiz lemon' as used in
the bitmap version.**
